# Room Control through phone
- Room Control Panel that can control lights, temperature and such through a simple app.

## Ideas
- Use old android phone
- Home assistant integration
- Control lights
    - with philips hue presets or hard coded presets
- Control temperature
- Time/Clock
- Intereseting statistics
- 3d printed plastic/laser cut wood case that houses phone and power
- turn down brightness to almost nothing when not in use

## Frameworks and Technologies
- Ionic app wrapper
    - use js ui frameworks
- Home assistant
- Something that can interact with home assistant through js

## Checklist/TODO  (may eventaully be divided into segments)
- [ ] Home assistant integration and functionality
- [ ] Design and ui and stuff
- [ ] Housing
